the most distant way in the world
is not the way from birth to the end
it is when i sit near you
that you understand i love u

the most distant way in the world
is not that not sure i love u
it is when my love is bewildering the soul
but i speak it out

the most distant way in the world
is not that i say i love u
it is after looking into my heart
i change my love

the most distant way in the world
is not that loving u
it is in our love
we are keeping between the distance

the most distant way in the world
is not the distance across us
it is when breaking through the way
we deny the existance of love

so the most distant way in the world
is not in two distant trees
it is the same rooted branches
enjoy the coexistance

so the most distant way in the world
is not in the being seperated branches
it is in the bliki stars
they burn the light

so the most distant way in the world
is not the burning stars
it is after the light
they be seen from afar

so the most distant way in the world
is not the light that is fading away
it is the coincidence of us
is not supposed for the love

so the most distant way in the world
is the love between the fish and bird
one is flying at the sky
the other is looking upon into the sea
